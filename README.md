This repository is built for recording and studying: **Silicon Photonics Integrated Circuits**.

Lumerical FDTD, MODE, DEVICE, INTERCONNECT will be used in the Code Repository.

## Scripts
File folder Scripts shows the codes for simulation of silicon photonics devices. Because of limit of material Si, the template of substrate SOI has been built in file SOI_draw.lsf.
